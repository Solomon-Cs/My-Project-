                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the term used to describe a programming approach 
                    based on objects and classes. 
                    It is a programming paradigm ,allows us to organize software as a collection of objects 
                    that consist of both data and behavior. 
                    The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism
                    Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data
                    Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods
                    Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming
                    OOP is faster and easier to execute
                    OOP provides a clear structure for the programs

                    Object is an instance of a class. 
                    Class is the description of a concept, and an object as the realization of this description
                    For example, in the case of the book, the class is the set of plans (or blueprints) for a generic book
                    Whereas a book object is the realization of these plans into a real-world physical object 
                    There would be one set of plans (the class), but there could be thousands of real-world book (objects).
